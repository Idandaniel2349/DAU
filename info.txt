Space complexity: Since we keep a map in the DAU class it will take
O(n) space when n is the number of lines in the file, for the n lines data that we save in the constructor.

Time complexity:
Since we already kept all the data in the map then calling 
"getUsersNum" takes O(1) since we only check if the date exists and if
it does we take its info. And since the map is a HashMap it takes O(1).

*Time complexity of constructor by istself is O(n) since it loops on all
n lines and does O(1) for each line.

More: time complexity can't be improved since it is already O(1).
You can improve space complexity if you do not save the DAU but 
open it in each call to function and run on all lines to get number of 
users in a certain date. That will get O(1) space but will change time to
O(n).
Since changes to thefile probably happen less often taking the better
time then space seems more benefical.
